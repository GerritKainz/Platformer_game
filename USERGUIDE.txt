2. MODIFY THE GAME:
 -You can mod this game!
 -You can make your own levels, characters and sounds and use them in the game.
 -You can change how many coins a level / character costs. 
  -Open the game_data.json file and change the number in "level_values" / "player_values".
   -For example, if you want to change how many the third level costs, change the third number (150 by default).
  -Save the file!
 -I recommend making a backup of the folders in case you want to get the original levels / characters / sounds back.
 -First, go to the directory of the .exe file of the game.

2.1 Modify Levels:
 -First, open the folder of the level pictures. Go into the 'pictures' folder and then into the 'levels' folder
 -You will see three pictures named '0.png', '1.png' and '2.png'.
 -You can now either edit those pictures or make new ones.

2.1.1 Edit Levels:
 -Open the picture of the level you want to change in a picture editing software.
 -Edit the picture.
  -You can delete or add ground pieces (the colored rectangles).
  -You can also add for example grass.
  -You can make the level smaller or bigger, the game will automatically adapt to the size of the level.
  -You can change the color of the background to any color you like.
  -If you change the background, you'll need to change the corresponding color in the collision_colors.py file.
   -Open the file and change e.g. the third rgb color if you are editing the third level (level 2!)
   -Save the file!
  -COINS:
   -You can add or delete coins.
   -To add a coin at a position, you only need to draw a pixel with a rgb value of 255, 255, 254 (pretty much white).
   -The program automatically places a coin on all pixels with this rgb value.
   (-If you don't know what rgb colors are and how to use them in your picture editing software, look it up, it's important for this!)
   -To delete a coin, change the color of the pixel to a different color (for example the background color).
   -You can change the 255, 255, 254 color to a color that is close to your background color (so that you don't see pixels on places where your character has collected a coin.
   -To do that, open the collision_colors.py file and change the coin_color to the new rgb value
  -COLLISION:
   -The collision in the game is dependent on the rgb colors of the ground pieces in the levels
   -If you make a ground piece with a color different from the ones that are already used in the game, you need to add the rgb color to the list of collision colors.
   -Open the collision_colors.py file and add the rgb value to the collision_colors_ground list.
   -If you add a piece that should kill the character when hitting it, add the color to the collision_colors_death list.
   -If you want the flag that finishes the level when hit to be a different color, add / change this color to the collision_colors_finish list.
   -(Of course this doesn't need to be a flag, only the color is important).
   -Make sure that your background color is different from any of the colors in any of those lists except for the background_colors list!

2.1.2 Make new Levels:
 -Making a new level is very similar to changing a level.
 -Draw the new level.
 -Make sure to handle the colors correctly (see 2.2.1 Change levels).
 -Save the new level in the levels folder.
 -Make sure to name the file properly (I'm sure you can recognise the pattern).
 -That's it, your new level will appear when you (re)start the game!
 -You can have a maximum of 8 levels (named 0.png, 1.png, 2.png, ... 7.png)!

2.2 Modify Characters:
 -Modifying characters is similar to modifying levels.
 -First, open the folder of the character pictures. Go into the 'pictures' folder and then into the 'players' folder.
 -You'll find folders named with numbers from 0 to 4.

2.2.1 Edit Characters:
 -Open one of the folders, you'll find 5 different pictures.
 -You can edit those pictures with a picture editing software.
 -When you're done, simply save them (overwrite the old picture).
 -The background should be white (255, 255, 255), the game will then make them transparent automatically!

2.2.2 Make new Characters:
 -You can also make new characters!
 -First, create a new folder in the 'players' folder (I'm sure you can figure out how you should name it!).
 -'big.png' is the picture that is displayed on the start screen for selecting the characters.
 -'jump.png' is displayed in the level when the player is jumping or stationary.
 -'dead.png' is displayed when the character died.
 -'running1.png' and 'running2.png' are displayed when the character is moving.
 -The backgrounds should be white (255, 255, 255), this will make the pictures transparent!
 -Make sure to name the files properly (I'm sure you can recognise the pattern).
 -You can have a maximum of 9 characters (folders named 0, 1, 2, ... 8)!
 -That's it, your new character will appear when you (re)start the game!

2.3 Modify Assets:
 -You can also change the coin picture, the pause button, ...
 -You can find those pictures in the 'menu' folder , which is in the 'pictures' folder.
 -The new pictures should be around the same size as the old ones.

2.4 Modify Sounds:
 -Copy the new sound file you want to have.
 -Open the 'sounds' folder.
 -Rightclick on the file you want to change, click 'rename' and copy the name.
 -Delete the file.
 -Paste the new file, rightclick it, select rename and paste the name of the old file.
 -'Music2.mp3' is played on the start and settings screen.
 -'Music1.mp3' is played in the level.
 -'smashsound.mp3' is played when the character dies.
 -'level_complete_sound.mp3' is played when the level is completed.
 -'ka-ching.mp3' is played when you buy a level or character.
 -'error.mp3' is played when you want to buy a level or character but you don't have enough coins.
 -It is important that the files have those exact names (they also need to be.mp3)!


3. SCREEN RESOLUTION:
 -The game should automatically adapt to your screen size.
 -If the resolution does not work or you want a different one, then you can change it.
 -Open the game_data.json file.
 -Set "automatic_resolution" to "False".
 -Change the values in "screen_resolution" to the width and height you want.
 -Save the file and (re)start the game.



Have fun!
